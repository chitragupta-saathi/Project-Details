**Saathi â€“ A feed for the need**
An Blockchain backend based IoMT(Internet of Medical Things) device to simplify diagnostic procedure at rural area and remote location of Rajasthan.

The IoMT device can help monitor, inform and notify not only caregivers, but provide healthcare providers with actual data to identify issues before they become critical or to allow for earlier invention.

We are unique across the diagnostic and blockchain healthcare space due to out profound product and data privacy model.

BlockChain is a decentralized model and will saves time reduces cost of intermediaries, reduce risk of tampering(frauds and cybercrime) of data and incerese trust.

We are using HyperLedger Platform for blockchain, and created a sample model which is working and saving data on a blockchain block.

For communication between IOMT device and cloud we have used **MQTT protocol (desgined for light weight node communication).**

Currently we are using IBM Watson Cloud for storage of our blockchain based database.

And we used **NodeRed** which is a flow-based development tool developed originally by IBM for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services as part of the Internet of Things.

By using above all technologies and tools we created A real Working IOMT device.
